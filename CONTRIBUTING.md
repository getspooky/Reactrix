# Contributing to Reactrix

We would love for you to contribute to Reactrix and help make it even better than it is
today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:


- [Submitting an Issue](#issue)
- [Submitting a Pull Request (PR)](#submit-pr)
- [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit)

### <a name="issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using a repository. Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/getspooky/Reactrix/pulls) for an open or closed PR
   that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
1. Fork the getspooky/Reactrix repo.
1. Make your changes in a new git branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
   ```

1. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
1. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
[commit message conventions](#commit). 

    ```shell
      git commit -a
    ```

1. Push your branch to GitHub:

   ```shell
   git push origin my-fix-branch
   ```
